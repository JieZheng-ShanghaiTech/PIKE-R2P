CITE-seq-preprocess.R / REAP-seq-preprocess.R

First, downloading the necessary R packages for preprocessing. The inputs are the multi-omics datasets, including CITE-seq-CBMC, CITE-seq-PBMC and REAP-seq datasets. The outputs are the denoised RNA datasets and the CLR-transformed protein expression datasets.


Test_set_seurat.R

The inputs are the test set of RNA and measured protein expression datasets, the predicted protein expression datasets based on PIKE-R2P and cTP-net for both CITE-seq-CBMC and CITE-seq-PBMC. The outputs are two Seurat objects for the above datasets.


figures.R

The file is used to plot figures, including clustering and FeaturePlot for two datasets. The inputs are the Seurat objects generated by the Test_set_seurat.R file.

R version: R version 3.6.2 (2019-12-12)

Saver-X: Installing the supporting Python packages sctransfer. The package only supports Python (>=3.5) and now works with tensorflow 2. SAVER-X accepts either a data file or a matrix object in R as input and returns the file name storing the denoised results. The data file can be ‘.txt’, ‘,csv’ or ‘.rds’ file.
